        Snow igloo with real beds inside. Nice atmosphere with led lights and
        white walls. Outside the igloo is possibility to see northern lights if
        you are lucky. Come to Lapland and explore the wilderness. It&apos;s
        always minus degrees&apos; inside the igloo. We provide warm sleeping
        bag but you should bring your thermos layers, warm hat, socks and
        cloves.
